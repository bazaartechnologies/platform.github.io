# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code instead of manual processes.

## Overview

Infrastructure as Code allows you to:
- Version control your infrastructure
- Automate deployment and management
- Ensure consistency across environments
- Implement infrastructure testing
- Enable collaboration through code review

## Popular IaC Tools

### Terraform
- HashiCorp's infrastructure as code tool
- Cloud-agnostic
- Declarative syntax
- Large provider ecosystem

### AWS CloudFormation
- Native AWS infrastructure as code
- JSON/YAML templates
- Integrated with AWS services

### Pulumi
- Modern infrastructure as code
- Supports multiple programming languages
- Strong typing and IDE support

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**
   - Store IaC in git repositories
   - Use branching strategies
   - Implement code review processes

2. **Modularity**
   - Create reusable modules
   - Implement DRY principles
   - Maintain clear documentation

3. **Security**
   - Implement least privilege
   - Use secret management
   - Regular security scanning

4. **Testing**
   - Unit testing
   - Integration testing
   - Policy compliance testing
